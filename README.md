# network-check
a simple tool to debug network connectivity problems.

## background

When debugging network connectivity problems remotely, e.g. for a friend over
telephone, I find myself asking the same questions over and over again:

- do you have an IP address?
- can you reach the router?
- does google.com work?
- etc...

**network-check** is supposed to automate these.
